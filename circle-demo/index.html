		<h1>Hit Demo</h1>

		<p> Click on the circles and they will change colors.</p>
		
		<p>This is the first test case for creating canvas hit areas.  The core of the code still needs to have the ability to do other kinds of events as well, but I am putting this up now in this partially completed state because my daughter enjoys playing with it.</p>
		
		<p> My animation engine now includes the responsive design module. So turn your phone to your hearts content and it should still work correctly now.</p>
