#Kip's 2014 Website

This was the first personal site that I have created. I have not touched it in
a couple of years because I made this site to learn rather than have much 
purpose. At the time I was very interested in the 2d canvas animations, though
it seems that even in the few years since I launched this site it is much more
popular to use the WebGL libraries like THREE.js or pixi.js. It has indeed 
served it's purpose and I have leared quite a bit of object oriented javascript
as well as some basic game-loop sorts of mechanics.

When I get a chance this website will be taken down in favor of a more
traditional blog. It is best for sites to have a purpose otherwise people
have no reason to visit.
